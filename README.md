# Run the server.py using python2
`python server.py`
When asked for `Enter PEM pass phrase`, type `2G9En5g6HXvCQP4T`

This PEM password is not necessary if you provide `-nodes` during certificate creation.

This will now run your server listening at port 8080.

# Verify Certificates
There are two folders:
- CApath/
- CApath2/

The correct root certificate is at `CApath`. Do the verification:

`openssl s_client -CApath ./CApath -connect localhost:8080</dev/null`

The important output to watch for is `Verify return code: 0 (ok)`. 

Try verifying with mismatch `CApath` by:

`openssl s_client -CApath ./CApath2 -connect localhost:8080</dev/null`

You will get the verification failure message as `Verify return code: 21 (unable to verify the first certificate)`

# Miscellaneous
The content of folder path `CApath` is generated by copying two `.pem` files into the folder. The claimed certificate of localhost,
and the certificate of the issuer. Then run, `c_rehash folder_path/`. 

What is not shown here is the creation of the root self-sign certificate, and a certificate signed by the root certificate.
